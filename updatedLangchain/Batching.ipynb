It was created by Brendan Eich in 1995 while he was working at Netscape Communications.\\n\\n**Key Features of JavaScript:**\\n\\n1. **Dynamic Typing**: JavaScript is dynamically typed, which means you don't need to declare the data type of a variable before using it.\\n2. **Object-Oriented**: JavaScript supports object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts such as classes, inheritance, and polymorphism.\\n3. **First-Class Functions**: JavaScript functions are first-class citizens, which means they can be passed around like variables, returned from functions, and stored in data structures.\\n4. **Async Programming**: JavaScript supports asynchronous programming using callbacks, promises, and async/await syntax.\\n5. **DOM Manipulation**: JavaScript allows you to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) of a web page, which enables dynamic and interactive user interfaces.\\n\\n**Common Use Cases of JavaScript:**\\n\\n1. **Front-end Web Development**: JavaScript is used to create interactive and dynamic web pages, including user interfaces, animations, and effects.\\n2. **Back-end Web Development**: Node.js, a JavaScript runtime environment, allows developers to run JavaScript on the server-side, enabling back-end web development.\\n3. **Mobile App Development**: JavaScript is used to develop mobile apps using frameworks like React Native and Angular.\\n4. **Desktop App Development**: Electron, a framework built on Node.js, allows developers to create desktop apps using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.\\n5. **Game Development**: JavaScript is used to develop games using frameworks like Phaser and PlayCanvas.\\n\\n**Popular JavaScript Frameworks and Libraries:**\\n\\n1. **React**: A popular front-end library for building user interfaces.\\n2. **Angular**: A full-fledged front-end framework for building complex web applications.\\n3. **Vue.js**: A progressive and flexible front-end framework for building web applications.\\n4. **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime environment for running JavaScript on the server-side.\\n5. **Express.js**: A popular back-end framework for building web servers and APIs.\\n\\n**Best Practices for Writing JavaScript Code:**\\n\\n1. **Use Consistent Naming Conventions**: Follow a consistent naming convention for variables, functions, and classes.\\n2. **Use Meaningful Variable Names**: Use descriptive and meaningful variable names to improve code readability.\\n3. **Follow the Single Responsibility Principle**: Keep functions and classes focused on a single responsibility to reduce complexity.\\n4. **Use Comments and Documentation**: Add comments and documentation to explain complex code and make it easier to understand.\\n5. **Test Your Code**: Write automated tests to ensure your code is correct and works as expected.\\n\\nBy following these best practices and using the right tools and frameworks, you can write high-quality JavaScript code that is efficient, maintainable, and scalable.\", additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 592, 'prompt_tokens': 38, 'total_tokens': 630, 'completion_time': 0.716413245, 'completion_tokens_details': None, 'prompt_time': 0.001860485, 'prompt_tokens_details': None, 'queue_time': 0.051405275, 'total_time': 0.71827373}, 'model_name': 'llama-3.1-8b-instant', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_ff2b098aaf', 'service_tier': 'on_demand', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None, 'model_provider': 'groq'}, id='lc_run--019b780d-383b-7461-b48a-dbf4dea62c12-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 38, 'output_tokens': 592, 'total_tokens': 630}),\n",
       " AIMessage(content=\"**What is TypeScript?**\\n======================\\nTypeScript is a statically typed, multi-paradigm programming language developed by Microsoft. It is a superset of the JavaScript language, which means that any valid JavaScript program is also a valid TypeScript program.\\n\\n**Key Features**\\n----------------\\n\\n### 1. **Type Safety**\\n\\nTypeScript introduces a static type system, which means that the type checker will analyze the code at compile time and prevent type-related errors at runtime. This helps catch errors early and improves code maintainability.\\n\\n### 2. **Object-Oriented Programming**\\n\\nTypeScript supports object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts such as classes, interfaces, inheritance, and polymorphism, making it easier to write reusable and maintainable code.\\n\\n### 3. **Type Inference**\\n\\nTypeScript can infer the types of variables, function parameters, and return types, reducing the need for explicit type annotations. This makes the code more concise and easier to read.\\n\\n### 4. **Modules and Encapsulation**\\n\\nTypeScript supports modules and encapsulation, which allows developers to organize code into reusable modules and protect sensitive information through access control.\\n\\n### 5. **Async and Await**\\n\\nTypeScript supports async/await syntax for writing asynchronous code, making it easier to write concurrent and responsive applications.\\n\\n### 6. **Interoperability**\\n\\nTypeScript is fully compatible with existing JavaScript libraries and frameworks, allowing developers to leverage the vast ecosystem of JavaScript libraries and frameworks.\\n\\n**Advantages**\\n----------------\\n\\n### 1. **Improved Code Quality**\\n\\nTypeScript's type system helps catch errors early, reducing the likelihood of runtime errors and improving overall code quality.\\n\\n### 2. **Better Code Maintainability**\\n\\nTypeScript's type system and OOP features make it easier to write reusable and maintainable code.\\n\\n### 3. **Increased Productivity**\\n\\nTypeScript's type inference and async/await syntax help developers write code faster and more efficiently.\\n\\n### 4. **Compatibility with JavaScript**\\n\\nTypeScript's compatibility with JavaScript allows developers to leverage the vast ecosystem of JavaScript libraries and frameworks.\\n\\n**Use Cases**\\n----------------\\n\\n1. **Enterprise Applications**: TypeScript is well-suited for large-scale enterprise applications that require robustness, scalability, and maintainability.\\n2. **Complex Web Applications**: TypeScript is ideal for complex web applications that require asynchronous programming, concurrency, and high-level abstractions.\\n3. **Mobile and Desktop Applications**: TypeScript can be used to develop mobile and desktop applications using frameworks like React Native and Electron.\\n4. **Machine Learning and AI**: TypeScript can be used to develop machine learning and AI applications using frameworks like TensorFlow.js and Brain.js.\\n\\n**Example Code**\\n```typescript\\n// Example of TypeScript code\\ninterface User {\\n  name: string;\\n  age: number;\\n}\\n\\nclass User {\\n  private name: string;\\n  private age: number;\\n\\n  constructor(name: string, age: number) {\\n    this.name = name;\\n    this.age = age;\\n  }\\n\\n  public getName(): string {\\n    return this.name;\\n  }\\n\\n  public getAge(): number {\\n    return this.age;\\n  }\\n}\\n\\n// Create an instance of User\\nconst user = new User('John Doe', 30);\\n\\n// Access properties and methods\\nconsole.log(user.getName()); // Output: John Doe\\nconsole.log(user.getAge()); // Output: 30\\n```\\nThis example demonstrates the basic syntax and features of TypeScript, including interfaces, classes, and type inference.\", additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 695, 'prompt_tokens': 38, 'total_tokens': 733, 'completion_time': 1.151127988, 'completion_tokens_details': None, 'prompt_time': 0.002277609, 'prompt_tokens_details': None, 'queue_time': 0.050533691, 'total_time': 1.153405597}, 'model_name': 'llama-3.1-8b-instant', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_1151d4f23c', 'service_tier': 'on_demand', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None, 'model_provider': 'groq'}, id='lc_run--019b780d-39f3-7c83-81ea-32dc92fd8b29-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 38, 'output_tokens': 695, 'total_tokens': 733})]"
